# Codex

Use your ChatGPT plan or an existing Codex CLI login to code in T3 Code.

## Connect with ChatGPT

Connect during onboarding or in **Settings → Providers**. For a remote machine,
select that environment first. T3 Code handles Codex installation; sign in on
OpenAI and allow sharing of your ChatGPT plan.

Manage shared usage and credits in ChatGPT through **Manage usage** in T3 Code.
If a request uses a feature that ChatGPT sharing does not support, use another
provider for that request.

When reconnecting, choose the same account in T3 Code and on OpenAI's sign-in
page. Disconnecting stops running threads but keeps their history and lets you
reconnect later.

If remote sign-in cannot return automatically, paste the full URL from the final
localhost page into the sign-in panel, even if that page could not load.

## Use an existing Codex login

T3 Code can use your installed Codex and its existing login. Run `codex login`
on the environment's machine to sign in. [Provider setup](./install.md#providers)
covers installation and custom configuration.

## Use multiple accounts

Add another ChatGPT account in **Settings → Providers**, then select the account
from the thread's model picker. Compatible accounts can continue the same thread.
Connecting accounts through T3 Code leaves your CLI login unchanged.

### Multiple CLI logins

A shared Codex home with a shadow home lets work and personal accounts continue
the same threads. The accounts share Codex sessions and configuration while keeping
their own login and available models.

Keep your first account in `~/.codex`. On the environment's machine, sign the
second account into a fresh directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_personal
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_personal codex login
```

Then add a second Codex instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance       | CODEX_HOME path | Shadow home path    |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Codex Work     | `~/.codex`      | Leave empty         |
| Codex Personal | `~/.codex`      | `~/.codex_personal` |

Both instances must use the same **CODEX_HOME path**. T3 Code prepares the shared
state in the shadow directory; do not populate it by copying your whole Codex
home.

The shadow account needs its own `auth.json` file. If Codex uses an OS credential
store, configure file storage for this setup. See
[OpenAI's credential storage guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth#credential-storage).

Use a completely separate **CODEX_HOME path**, with no shadow home, when you want
separate Codex sessions and configuration. That instance cannot continue threads
from the other home.

## Switch accounts in an existing thread

Choose the other account from the thread's model picker. T3 Code offers compatible
Codex instances that share the thread's **CODEX_HOME path**. Changing accounts does
not move the conversation into a separate Codex home.

If the account is missing from the picker, compare the home paths in provider
settings. If two instances show the same unexpected account or models, check their
reported accounts, refresh provider status, and confirm the second instance has
its own shadow path and login. A shadow-home conflict usually means the directory
contains a copied Codex setup. Use a fresh shadow directory and sign in again.

## Answer questions while Codex works

Codex can ask a question and keep working. Answer it in the thread's question
panel. The answer becomes a new message: it reaches the active turn, or starts
another turn if Codex has finished. Unanswered questions survive reconnects.
If you do not want to answer, dismiss the question from its panel. Dismissing
closes it without sending anything to Codex. This requires a Codex version that
supports async questions.

## Approve app access

Codex tools can request access to another app. Respond to the named app's request
in the thread on web, desktop, or mobile. Some tools offer access for one request,
the current session, or permanently. See [Permission modes](./permission-modes.md)
for command and file approvals.

## Voice conversations

A Codex thread can hold a spoken conversation. You talk with
a voice model that hands coding requests to Codex and reads its answers back to
you. Any Codex thread can start one, including a new thread with no messages, and
**Talk** next to the new-thread button starts a new thread with voice on.

Start or stop it with the waveform button in the composer. On web and desktop you
can also send `/voice` or press `F8`. While it runs, the strip above the composer shows whether it is
listening or speaking, with buttons to mute your microphone and stop. The command
palette offers the same actions, and **Voice: Toggle Mute** can be bound in
**Settings > Keybindings**.

Choose the voice in **Settings > Providers > Codex > Voice**. The change applies
to your next conversation.

The conversation keeps running while you move around the app. Other threads show a
small strip with the latest words, mute, stop and **Talk here**, which moves the
conversation to the thread you're in; elsewhere a round voice button floats on screen,
which you can drag anywhere and tap for the same controls. To get back to the
conversation, click its words on web and desktop, or long-press the strip or the
round button on mobile. The thread you're talking in sits at the top of the sidebar.
A thread started with **Talk** is named after the first thing you say. Each device
holds one conversation; starting the same thread on another device moves the
conversation there.

Ask to open something, such as a thread, the inbox, a file or the thread's changes,
and it opens on the device you're talking from.

On mobile, the conversation stops when you leave the app. The mobile
app needs an update that includes voice support.

Voice needs a microphone and permission to use it. When you open T3 Code from
another device, the page must be served over HTTPS for the browser to allow the
microphone. Live captions are not saved: the thread keeps only the requests
handed to Codex and Codex's replies.

## Codex says I hit a usage limit

When Codex stops on a usage limit, the thread names the window that ran out and
when it resets, when Codex reports them. Send the message again after the reset. On a workspace plan the
message also says whether your workspace owner needs to add credits or raise the
spend limit to continue sooner.

## Send feedback to OpenAI

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` with an optional description, for
example `/feedback The agent stopped before finishing the tests`. This uploads
the conversation and Codex logs to OpenAI. The returned thread ID can be shared
with OpenAI support.
